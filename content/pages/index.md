          Jarm has been working with computers ever since she can remember. She
          sees the value in them, and she loves to help others see what she
          sees. As the first woman head of marketing at Palantir, she faced a
          lot of challenges to reach where she is now, but she's glad for the
          struggle and feels like it made her a stronger individual. She's the
          author of the much-lauded feminist book *From Lean In To Step Over: A
          Woman's Guide to Success in the Enterprise.*
