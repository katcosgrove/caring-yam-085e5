      This is an elaborate shitpost by [Kat
      Cosgrove](https://twitter.com/dixie3flatline), because she wanted to make
      a "these nuts" joke but can't resist over-engineering every tiny little
      fucking thing.


      Special thanks to the Tech Shitposters Illuminati, and in particular to
      tef, Manish, Ti, Luna, and Sy.
